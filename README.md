# Fantasy Herbal TUI
## Overview
This was one of my first Python Projects back in 2022. I was playing around with the curses module and I was pretty strongly fixated on a DnD campaign idea. This Terminal User Interface was meant to serve as an encyclopedia of herbs that one of my players would collect over the course of the campaign. The encyclopedia contains information on where the herb is found, the season it grows, the typical cost, medicinal uses, etc.
